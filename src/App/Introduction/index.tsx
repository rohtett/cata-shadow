        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Shadow Priest has a rocky start to the expansion; having two very strong healing specialisations to them, Shadow became very underappreciated. By Dragon Soul patch, Shadow can easily be recognised as a strong damage spec, matching and even exceeding some of its ranged competitors.</p>
        <p>The strengths of Shadow lies in it's ability to cleave enemies at range. Shadow is un-matched when it comes to its multi-dotting (hitting multiple targets with damage over time) abilities, surpassing even Affliction Warlock and Balance Druid. This allows it to easily surpass Shamans in situations where enemies cannot stand close enough to be cleaved otherwise.</p>
